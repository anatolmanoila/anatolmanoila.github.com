In this screencast tutorial I want to take the plunge on describing the process how & when to use RSpec applying Behavioral Driven Development technique, by building a complete Rails 4 app. As the example, we'll be building a _**Comments Dasboard** application that will be used to fetch comments from various blogs that my app knows about and will display a list of comments that people have commented thoughout the day - on the topics that are of interest to me (the user)._ Thus, I can see all the nicely displayed comments from a single common interface on my desktop or mobile web browser. As it turns out to be, it's a great example of an app that uses many concepts of _in-production_ applications.

In this blog post, we'll use RSpec in isolation, to implement the _first_ feature of the application.

### Goals for RSpec alone
✓ Understanding the _describe_ and _it_ methods

✓ _Implement_ the first feature: create a Wordpress client and give it a URL
